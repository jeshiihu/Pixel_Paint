======================= FINAL PROJECT: Pixel Paint! =======================


======== Description ========
The program was written on Ubuntu VM of a Macintosh.

pixelpaint.cpp is a simple paint program that allows users to draw an image onto the LCD Screen with various colours, pencil shapes, sizes, as well as erase and clear the image.

======== Physical Setup ========
The Arduino was connected via usb cable w/ joystick and lcd.

NOTE: The joystick is postioned and wired so that the Vertial arrow points in the leftward direction, towards the arduino. An image is provided of the wiring:

======== Code ======== 
** IMP NOTE 1: Please do not move the joystick immediately after uploading the code to allow for proper calibration of the joystick.**

** IMP NOTE 2: Please align the potentiometer to its centre position before uploading to ensure proper initial cursor display.**

Upon upload, the LCD shows a blank canvas with the following icons on the bottom of the screen: Colour Selection, Pencil Mode, Eraser Mode, Shape Selection, and Clear, respectively.
The cursor may be moved around using the joystick and will only draw/erase on the canvas while the joystick is held down.

------- Multiple Files -------
pixel_paint.cpp:
- main cpp file containing the setup and loop that calls on the functions

functions.cpp:
- cpp file that contains the functions used in pixel_paint.cpp

functions.h:
- header file that allows the two cpp files to be linked
- enables the functions to be used by various cpp files by adding the line:
    #include "functions.h"

------- Icons -------
Colour Selection:
- user may click on the desired colour and the pencil is now set to that colour

Pencil Mode:
- allows user to draw on the canvas with the pencil
- when user clicks on the pencil mode from the eraser mode, the cursor will return to its previous shape and colour from before entering the eraser mode

Eraser Mode:
- allows user to go over parts of the canvas they wish to erase
- note: in this mode you cannot change the colour of the eraser 

Shape Selection:
- user can click on the icon and the shape of the pencil/eraser will change in the following order: square (default), circle, slash.

Size of Cursor:
- user can change the size of the cursor (size corresponds to approximately a cursor_size by cursor_size space)
- available sizes: 4, 8, and 12
- implemented by using the potentiometer and the LEDs indicate what size user is currently using: size 4 = 1 led on, size 8 = 2 leds on, size 12 = 3 leds on

Clear:
- user can clear the entire canvas to a blank canvas by clicking on this icon
